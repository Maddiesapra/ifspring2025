I think I want the format to have an introduction page to introduce the characters, then every page be a chapter summary (one page per season). This wikipedia page already has descriptions or the characters and each season, but I would also want to include my own information 

Page 1: intro & characters 
Introduce show and introduce main characters 
Bojack Horseman, Princess Carolyn, Todd Chavez, Diane Nguyen, and Mr. Peanut Butter
Page 2: Season 1 
Page 3: Season 2
