        <p style="color:pink">1) Hi! My name is Maddie Sapra. I am a sophomore studying Data Science and minoring in Human-Computer Interaction.</p>
        <p style="color:pink">2) I am taking this class for my HCI minor and am very excited to take it because it is my first-ever communications design class!</p>
        <p style="color:pink">3) I have no previous experience with HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
        <p style="color:pink">4) I am really interested in UX strategy, so I would really like to learn about strategy and optimal design.</p>
        <p style="color:pink">5) I think the most important thing about designing for a screen is to make it simple and clear to use, so it is accessible for everyone, regardless of their technological background.</p>
        <p style="color:pink">6) I think a website that exemplifies effective design is <a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>! The ability to curate boards and ideas in so many different ways makes it easy to use and visually appealing.</p>
        <p style="color:pink">7) I think a website that exemplifies effective communication is <a href="https://www.latimes.com" target="_blank">LA Times</a>, but really just news sites in general. I am signed up for a lot of news sites and have the apps, and feel like I am constantly being communicated information about every news story.</p>
        <p style="color:pink">8) I think a website that works well is <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. I use Amazon all the time, as I'm sure most of us do, and the ability to add previously bought items to your cart, see delivery dates, and more makes it a great website to use!</p>
