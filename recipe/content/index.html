        <h2> Recipe page reviews</h2>
        <p> <b>1)</b>The first recipe page I am reviewing is the one I got this recipe from, it is called <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/254923/delicious-blackberry-muffins/" target="_blank">AllRecepies</a>. I like how this recipe page is very straight forawd and clear with the directions, while still being visually attractive. However, on every recipe it has a place for user engagment, but for all the recipe's I checked, no one had used this feature, making it seem like no one has made this recipe before. This could make a user trust this site less. I would either encourage them to disable this feature, or encourage user engagment. </p>
        <p> <b>2)</b>The second recipe page I am reviewing is <a href="https://pinchofyum.com" target="_blank">Pinch of Yum</a>. I really liked how on the cover page of this recipe site, you could click on dietary restrictions and it would take you to a list of recipes that fits your needs. I also like how much they highlighted the picutres of thier food, and made me really want to make their recipe.</p>
        <p> <b>3)</b>The third recipe page I am reviewing is <a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com:" target="_blank">Sally's Baking Addiction</a>. I similarly like how clearly they displayed pictures of their desserts. Also, I really like their color scheme, as it is all pastel and colorful, which matches the vibe of their food. All of their icons were little desserts, and matched the color scheme.</p>

        <h2> Non-Recipe page reviews</h2>
        <p> <b>1)</b>The first non-recipe page I am reviewing is <a href="https://www.pinterest.com" target="_blank">Pintrest</a>. I have talked about how I like the design of this website before beacuse it priortizes visual design while still being functional and useful. Because I want to make a desert website, I think I can find good inspiration on here.</p>
        <p> <b>2)</b>The second non-recipe page I am reviewing is <a href="https://www.apple.com/store?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_724099485023_pgrid_13945964887_pntwk_g_pchan__pexid__ptid_kwd-10778630_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand-apple--slid---product-" target="_blank">Apple</a>. They take a very simplistic approach and use ltos of white space which makes it very clean. While I want a more colorful website, what I can take away from Apple is having various buttons on their website be their product. </p>
        <p> <b>3)</b>The third non-recipe page I am reviewing is another one I have previosuly discussed, <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. What I like about this is their user engagment and how many people comment and review posts. This is a big contrast to the recipes page above, where no one interacted with the posts. If I want to have an interactive part of my page, I would want it to be like Amazons.  </p>
